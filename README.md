## About
- ChatSafetyAI is built with care by Antoine Tixier at [SafetyAI](https://www.safetyai.io) üõ†Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
- ChatSafetyAI relies on the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).
- OpenAI [does not](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data) use the conversations for training their models, and does not store the conversations permanently.
- Screencast demos (not necessarily up-to-date) can be found on our [website](https://www.safetyai.io).
