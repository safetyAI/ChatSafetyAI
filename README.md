# ChatSafetyAI

Help us improve ChatSafetyAI by taking this [quick survey](https://forms.gle/E6sK87u7DdoL4Kg86) !

## About
- ChatSafetyAI is built with care by [SafetyAI](https://www.safetyfunction.com/safetyai-details) üõ†Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
- ChatSafetyAI relies on the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).
- OpenAI [does not](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data) use the conversations for training their models, and does not store the conversations permanently.
- We at SafetyAI record conversations for continuous improvement purposes. Conversations are inspected at random. Only one person has access.
- Screencast demos (not necessarily up-to-date) can be found on our [website](https://www.safetyfunction.com/safetyai-details).

- Better wrapping of file content to avoid any confusion with user query, clarified that SCL has nothing to do with safety climate in function description and general instructions (to address TCE bug report)

### 11-10-24
- Image and text anonymization: Face and logo blurred in photos; names of people, places, and organizations redacted in text (optional, TRUE by default).
- LLM switch for vision things, to fix the "Sorry, I can't help with this request" issue with GPT.
  
### 10-18-24

- favicon attempt (turns out it works locally but not on shinyapps.io)

### 09-16-24
- fixed vertical space avatar badge mobile
- fixed budget bars in avatar modal (demo)

- refined HECA instructions
- function instructions now reject HECA for photos not depicting job site situations
- knowledge of acronyms to off-topic classifier and better instructions

- support for non-English headlines
- refactoring of adversarial and off-topic classifiers to reduce false alarms, especially in non-English languages

Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this section by its employees, contractors, and agents. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that Recipient uses reasonable efforts to notify Discloser in advance.

### Privacy
We at the Colorado Construction Safety Laboratory, LLC ('we', 'our' or 'us') respect your privacy and are strongly committed to keeping secure any information we obtain from you or about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to Personal Information we receive from or about you when you use our Services.

**Personal Information You Provide:** We receive Personal Information if you create an account to use our Services or communicate with us as follows:
- email address.

**Personal Information We Receive Automatically From Your Use of the Services:** When you use the Services, we receive the following information:
- *User Content:* the date and time of each conversation, as well as the conversation content. This is necessary to allow saving and reloading the chat history from session to session. We use Dropbox as our main data storage solution, Google Drive for hosting the automatically¬†generated PPT files (presentation¬†mode...) and PDF files (prejob brief summarization, chat sharing...), and Amazon EC2 for some data storage and to host the microservices of ours that ChatSafetyAI calls (regulations, predictions, etc.). ChatSafetyAI is deployed on Posit's shinyapps.io but data is only saved there temporarily, for the duration of the session. We record and analyze conversations for sole continuous improvement purposes. If you do not want us to use your conversations for improvement of our Services, or if you do not want your conversations to be saved at all (no chat history from session to session), you may opt out by emailing `antoine.tixier AT safetyfunction DOT com`. Please note that this may limit the ability of our Services to better address your specific use cases.
- *OpenAI API:* To function, ChatSafetyAI relies on the OpenAI API's Chat and Embeddings endpoints. OpenAI [does not](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data) use the data passed to their API for training their models, and only temporarily saves the data (for 30 days) for moderation purposes, after which it is permanently deleted.
- *Content Disclosure:* we **do not** share or sell your content with/to anyone. We record and analyze your conversations for the sole purpose of improving our models, if you have not opted out.
- *IP address, device and browser information, logs, and other analytics:* we **do not** record such information. We may ask for your location (latitude and longitude) for the sole purpose of knowing your local weather, in order for our incident characteristics predictive models to generate more accurate predictions.

- *Cookies:* we **do not** use cookies. Shinyapps.io, on which ChatSafetyAI is deployed, may collect a cookie for the sole purpose of allowing you to log in without having to re-enter your username and password every time.
