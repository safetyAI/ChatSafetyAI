# ChatSafetyAI

## About
- ChatSafetyAI is built with care by [SafetyAI](https://www.safetyfunction.com/safetyai-details) üõ†Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
- ChatSafetyAI relies on the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).
- OpenAI [does not](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data) use the conversations for training their models, and does not store the conversations permanently.
- We at SafetyAI record conversations for continuous improvement purposes.
- Screencast demos (not necessarily up-to-date) can be found on our [website](https://www.safetyfunction.com/safetyai-details).

## Usage Tiers
There is a free [demo](https://safetyapp.shinyapps.io/chatsafetyai_demo_access_request/) with a limited budget, just for quick testing purposes.<br>
Contact us for membership pricing (see contact info at the bottom of this page, or on our [website](https://www.safetyfunction.com/safetyai-details)).<br>
Note: we do not currently offer plans for individuals, SafetyAI membership is for companies only.
